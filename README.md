# Sleep-Quality-Prediction-Model
A machine learning and deep learning project that predicts sleep quality (Good / Poor) using lifestyle and wearable-related data. The study compares multiple classical ML models, deep learning architectures, and ensemble methods to evaluate performance, accuracy, and efficiency for real-world sleep monitoring applications.
