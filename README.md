# 💤 Sleep Quality Prediction Model

This project predicts **sleep quality (Good / Poor)** using **lifestyle and wearable-related data** such as sleep duration, stress level, heart rate, daily steps, BMI, and age.  
The main goal is to **compare different Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models** and analyze their performance for sleep detection.

## 🎯 What This Project Does
- Uses **structured lifestyle data** (no raw sensor signals)
- Compares **multiple ML and DL models**
- Evaluates models using **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and AUC**
- Identifies **efficient models suitable for real-world applications**

## 📊 Dataset
- **Sleep Health and Lifestyle Dataset**
- Contains **demographic, behavioral, and physiological features**
- Sleep quality is classified as:
  - **Good Sleep:** ≥ 85% sleep efficiency
  - **Poor Sleep:** < 85% sleep efficiency
